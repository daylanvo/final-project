            <div id="frank">Zaire Franklin is one of those guys who doesn't always get the credit he deserves, but if you're a Colts fan, you know how much he means to the team. He’s just a baller. Always flying around the field, making tackles, and doing the little things that don’t always shows up in the box score. In 2024, he’s still out there doing his thing—hitting hard, stopping the run, and leading the defense. He’s not out here looking for the spotlight, but if you really watch him, you can see how much he brings every game. As a Colts fan in Indiana, it’s easy to root for someone like Zaire—he’s tough, dependable, and always giving it 100%. That’s why he’s my favorite.</div>
